# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢 | Machine Learning Project

This project presents a complete pipeline for predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning models. It is part of a classic Kaggle competition: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

## 📊 Problem Statement

The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: *"What sorts of people were more likely to survive?"* using passenger data (like age, sex, class, etc).

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

The pipeline includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load and inspect `train.csv` and `test.csv`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations and statistics to understand data distributions and correlations.
   - Insights from features like `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Age`, `Fare`, `Embarked`, etc.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values (imputation for `Age`, `Fare`, `Embarked`, etc.).
   - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`).
   - Feature engineering (e.g., extracting titles from names).
   - Feature scaling (if required).

4. **Modeling**
   - Training multiple machine learning models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Evaluating models using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

5. **Model Selection**
   - Selecting the best-performing model.
   - Tuning hyperparameters for improved performance.

6. **Prediction**
   - Generating predictions on the test set.
   - Creating a submission file for Kaggle.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model is trained and evaluated to compare performance on the dataset.

## 📈 Results

- The project reports accuracy scores for all models.
- The best model is selected based on performance metrics.
- Final predictions are saved in `gender_submission.csv`.

> **Note:** For detailed accuracy scores and confusion matrices, refer to the `Titanic.ipynb` notebook.
